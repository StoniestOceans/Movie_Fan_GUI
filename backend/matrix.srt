1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,100
Like everyone else you were born into bondage.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,800
Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
A prison for your mind.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
You have to see it for yourself.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
You take the blue pill, the story ends.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,000
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,000
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
